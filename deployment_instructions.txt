0. Install docker
1. Clone the repository,        
    git clone https://github.com/cs-education/classTranscribe.git
   Checkout the fa18 branch
    git checkout fa18   
2. Navigate to the github repository.
3. Download the zip "cert" from, https://uillinoisedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mahipal2_illinois_edu/EcNfPMRp3clFtJf2sNWkhgEBvF8ZZDH4O0T34f7ixIuY-A?e=MMUT5H
    It contains certificates for https.(You'll need to login with your @illinois.edu Id's)
   Unzip it into the github repository    
3. Run the command "docker build -t cs-education/classtranscribe ."
    What this does is, tries to develop the image from the .DockerFile present in the root directory of the repository
4. If everything went right, you should see a message at the end "Successfully built xxxxxxx"
5. The docker image can be viewed by the command "docker images", which gives a list of all the images present
6. Pull a redis image from docker - "docker pull redis"
7. docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis redis-server
    This should start the docker container, you could see the running containers with the command - "docker ps"
    Copy the containerId for redis, you'll need that for the next step.
8. Run the following command to start the cs-education/classtranscribe container
docker run -i -t -p 443:8000 -p 80:7000 --link <Redis_ContainerId>:redis -e "MAILER_ID=classtranscribe@gmail.com" -e "MAILER_PASS=NRRQeuQtuFa2X1p61rchNuTe7yqTTNh0" -e "REDIS_PASS=5z&Joj#FdNmI3lZc" -e "EMAIL_ID=classtranscribenoreply@gmail.com" -e "EMAIL_PASS=db2c10cf68b6456086d2d54175ba4cb5" cs-education/classtranscribe /bin/bash
Please read about the above arguments of docker (namely -i, -t, -p, -e, -v etc.)
    The above command should start the bash within the container
9. A few packages are missing at this point within the container, run the following commands,
    npm install passport-hash
    npm audit fix
10. Start the node server,
    npm start
11. And now, hopefully (if my instructions are right) your node server should start.
12. You can access it via your browser on the address "https:///127.0.0.1"


A few useful articles

Remember,
On exiting a container your changes ARE NOT persisted. So step 9 onwards nothing gets persisted until you commit.
