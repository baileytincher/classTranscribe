How to generate certificates using letsencrypt

Install some packages,
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot

sudo certbot certonly

(Choose to spawn a temporary webserver when prompted, and give the domain names)

If all done right,
Should generate certificates, and should give the path to certificate files
Note, the paths are to symbolic links.
Resolve them using the command,
readlink -f "$path"

Copy the files chain.pem, fullchain.pem, privkey.pem, cert.pem to a folder cert.
cert must be in the classtranscribe repository folder.
